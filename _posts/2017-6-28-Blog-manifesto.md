Research in a digital age is all about order, keeping all information in a common structure, be it for later review, for the design of a concept or to provide evidence of past work to apply to new grants/ justify the existing ones.

In that context, blogging fulfills in my opinion more than one purpose. It is a technical challenge to implement something flexible enough to be integrated in a normal workflow, while at the same time offering an easy to present and share archive of past thoughts that could enable further discussions.

Aside from that, a blog enforces the writing habits and the skills needed to bring thoughts into a digital support with a reasonable level of clarity. It is a continous training on the path to write a dissertation.

It is a backlog of sources and ideas.
