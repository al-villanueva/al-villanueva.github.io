title: Blog Manifesto
---

Research in a digital age is all about order, keeping all information in a common structure, be it for later review, for the design of a concept or to provide evidence of past work to apply to new grants/ justify the existing ones.

In that context, blogging fulfills in my opinion more than one purpose. It is a technical challenge to implement something flexible enough to be integrated in a normal workflow, while at the same time offering an easy to present and share archive of past thoughts that could enable further discussions.

Aside from that, a blog enforces the writing habits and the skills needed to bring thoughts into a digital support with a reasonable level of clarity. It is a continous training on the path to write a dissertation.

It is a backlog of sources and ideas.

Here are some reasons behind this blog in tabular form.

Nr|Reasons|Description

---|---|---

1|Traceability|It lets me see when did i come up with a certain idea

2|Knowledge repository|It lets me clear up my browser tabs for new projects

3|Content drafts| Eventually if this is good enough, it can be taken into a Latex file

And an image that can serve as inspiration and as reminder of the image insertion syntax
