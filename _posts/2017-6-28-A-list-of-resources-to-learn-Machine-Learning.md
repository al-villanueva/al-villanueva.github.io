title: A list of resources to learn Machine Learning
---

As much as I have tried to keep it under control, the amount of interesting websites that I find to learn more about the specifics of Machine Learning keeps growing and growing. The number of open tabs is now unmanageable, and so I think the best solution to this, is to list them down along with some note on why are these links important:

1. [Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) : Tutorial for Deep Learning with implementation examples. From the ASDM 2017 Summer School
2. [ML Course from Ng](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=MachineLearning) : A ML course from Andrew Ng on Stanford. All in video format.
3. [A Tutorial for Decision Trees w/ R or Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/) : Focuses on modeling the tree, thus going into the details of the parameters that modify the final result. Also cover all variants.
4. [CS229 Materials](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html) : All slides from a Machine Learning by Ng at Standford. Not sure if it relates to the videos in the second link. But the reviews and every chapter are very useful.
5. [AutoML Accepted Papers](https://sites.google.com/site/automl2016/accepted-papers) : List and download links for all papers related with the automation of Machine Learning Workshop of 2016
6. [ML Summer School 2017](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2017/speakers.html): Some slides and topics covered in the Machine Learning Summer School of 2017 in Tübingen. Hopefully it will get updated with more slides.
7. [Algorithmauswahl für Azure ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-choice) : A cheat sheet in german to decide which algorithm to choose.
8. [Cheatsheet für ML Algorithmen](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-algorithm-cheat-sheet) : The actual cheat sheet that is used in the previous article to discuss the choice of a specific algorithm.
