title: A list of resources to learn Machine Learning
---

As much as I have tried to keep it under control, the amount of interesting websites that I find to learn more about the specifics of Machine Learning keeps growing and growing. The number of open tabs is now unmanageable, and so I think the best solution to this, is to list them down along with some note on why are these links important:

- [Deep Learning Tutorial](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/UFLDL_Tutorial) : Tutorial for Deep Learning with implementation examples. From the ASDM 2017 Summer School
- [ML Course from Ng](http://openclassroom.stanford.edu/MainFolder/CoursePage.php?course=MachineLearning) : A ML course from Andrew Ng on Stanford. All in video format.
- [A Tutorial for Decision Trees w/ R or Python](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/04/complete-tutorial-tree-based-modeling-scratch-in-python/) : Focuses on modeling the tree, thus going into the details of the parameters that modify the final result. Also cover all variants.
